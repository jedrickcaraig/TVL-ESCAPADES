      <h2>EXPO: CASEITFY</h2>
      <p>Caseitfy is another store from TVL students that performed their product, which is a
         phone case and tempred glass. They pick this as their product because they notice some 
         stundets and even them don't have one, which can give protection to their cellphones and 
         make them safe even if they fall on hard structures or things. The phone case and tempred 
         glass they sold are more than they expected, which means they said that they were successfully 
         accomplishing Expo 2024, and the capital has returned.</p>
