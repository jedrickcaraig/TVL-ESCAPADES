        <h2>FLAIRTENDING ACTIVITY FOR GRADE 11</h2>
        <p>The Grade 11 Home Economics strand students took part in a fun flair-tending activity 
          to showcase their skills in mixing and serving drinks. With bottles twirling and glasses
           spinning, the students impressed their classmates and teachers with their flair-tending 
           abilities. This hands-on activity not only allowed the students to demonstrate their creativity
            but also taught them the importance of presentation and showmanship in the food and beverage industry. 
            Well done, Grade 11 H.E. students.</p>
